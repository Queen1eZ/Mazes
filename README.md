# Mazes

## OverviewÂ¶
Mazes represents the transition into real world applications of data structures and algorithms. In this project, I will compare 3 implementations of graph algorithms for constructing and solving mazes. By the end of this project, I will be able to:

Understand and extend an existing codebase.  
Implement nontrivial algorithms involving multiple ADTs and data structures.
